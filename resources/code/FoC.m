% This function identifies the peaks that belong to MA.
% INPUTS:
% acc_data = the 3 acceleration data (x, y and z)
% y = components of a signal
% Fs = sample rate
% prevBPM = previous estimated HR
% sigma=ratio for which acceleration data will be considered
% MA_tol= the interval where the accelesration data and the PPG-signal
% data must coincide (MA_tolerance)h
% BPM_tol= the interval where the PPG signal peaks do not get
% filtered out (BPM_tolerance)
% OUTPUT:
% y_new=the filtered PPG signal.
